  Dataset description

Using the elbo methon on Kmean clusters (5) we can less significant decrease in inertia after 5 clusters.

Distribution of clusters after performing kmean prediction
cluster
3 4443
0 2760
4 1065
2 195
1 64
Name: count, dtype: int64

We can see cluster 3 has the most customers, followed by cluster 0 and cluster 1 has the least amount of customers.

Summarize cluster data (mean)
![Alt text](data/cluster_summary.png)

Based on the cluster summary, we can label the segments:

1.) Loyal Customers (Cluster 2):

High total orders, high purchase frequency, low recency and High revenue.

Example: Customers who shop frequently and recently.

2.) At-Risk Customers (Cluster 4):

High recency, low purchase frequency and low total orders.

Example: Customers who havenâ€™t shopped in a while.

3.) Infrequenty Shopper (Cluster 0):

Low total orders, low product diversity, low recency.

Example: Customers who have placed only a few orders infrequently.

4.) Bulk Buyers (Cluster 1):

High total orders, high product diversity, High reorder ratio.

Example: Customers who buy large quantities or a variety of products.

4.) Regular Buyer (Cluster 3):

low total orders, Moderate Purchase frequency, low product diversity

Example: Customers who buy same products repeatedly.

Action to Take (suggestions)

Loyal Customers: Offer loyalty rewards or exclusive discounts.

At-Risk Customers: Send re-engagement emails/texts or special offers.

New Customers: Provide welcome discounts or product recommendations.

Bulk Buyers: Offer bulk discounts or subscription plans.
